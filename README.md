# Chips Compo Bug & Feature Requests

This is where we track bug and feature requests for [Chips Compo!](www.chipscompo.com)

If you've found a bad bug (exposing anonymous usernames, deleting other people's accounts, seeing results early, stuff like that), please PM me on Discord and do not post it here.

OTHERWISE:

### If you've found a bug or want a feature:

1. Head on over to our [issues page](https://github.com/johnfn/chips/issues).
2. Check to see if someone has already posted what you want.
3. If they have, THUMBS UP that request.

4. If they haven't, add a new issue. 

Thank you for making Chips Compo great again! :D
